## Sample applications

Having done the [tutorials](./tutorials), if you'd like to explore some existing code, there are a variety of samples and existing applications available to be inspired from.

* [OSLC 2020 Reference Implementation](https://github.com/oslc-op/refimpl)
* The [iotp-adaptor](./iotp-adaptor-sample) is an OSLC adapter for IBM Watson IoT Platform. This sample provides a thourough user guide, as well as a developer guide covering many topics such as authentication, TRS, using [Lyo Designer](./eclipse_lyo/eclipse-lyo#lyo-designer), etc.
* [Lyo Client sample code](https://github.com/OSLC/lyo-samples) - A Github repository that includes sample code to demonstrates how to use the oslc4j-client in Lyo SDK  to interact with OSLC Service Providers in various ways. It addresses a variety of common OSLC use cases including login, OAuth, service discovery, and queries. See the [README.md](https://github.com/OSLC/lyo-samples/blob/master/README.md) file in the repository for further pointers.
* [JIRA OSLC Plugin](https://github.com/Ericsson/jira-oslc-plugin) - is a Lyo-based implementation of an OSLC Server and Client, realized as an OSGI (JIRA) plugin.
* [Hansoft OSLC Adaptor](https://github.com/Ericsson/hansoft-oslc-adapter) - is a Lyo-based implementation of an OSLC adaptor for the product planning tool Hansoft.
* [SharePoint](https://wiki.eclipse.org/Lyo/SharepointAdapter) - This SharePoint adapter looks through the sharepoint OData collections for collections where the ContentType is defined as "Document". For each SharePoint library that contains documents, an OSLC service provider is created with the basic services for OSLC Delegated dialogs for selection and creation as well as listing the documents with a UI preview.
* The [Hudson and Jenkins](https://wiki.eclipse.org/Lyo/JenkinsPlugin) adapor implements the OSLC Automation specification.
* [Simulink](https://wiki.eclipse.org/Lyo/Simulink)
* [MagicDraw](https://wiki.eclipse.org/Lyo/MagicDraw)
* The [Lyo LDP reference implementation](https://wiki.eclipse.org/Lyo/BuildLDPSample) - is a sample Java implementation of the W3C Linked Data Platform 1.0 Candidate Recommendation using JAX-RS (Apache CXF) and Jena TDB.



* The Communications Workgroup has [a list of **Open Source OSLC projects**](https://archive.open-services.net/wiki/communications/Open-source-software-and-tools/) (along with their licenses).
* If you'd like to explore a basic application that provides OSLC Service Provider resources and UI previews, Vijay Kalangumvathakkal of developerWorks [has some simple applications available to download and try out](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/mydeveloperworks/blogs/69ec672c-dd6b-443d-add8-bb9a9a490eba/entry/build_your_own_serviceprovider_that_provides_resource_preview_based_on_oslc_specifications_in_no_time4?lang=en).

The [OSLC4Net](https://github.com/OSLC/oslc4net) project includes sample applications if you favor .NET/C#.
