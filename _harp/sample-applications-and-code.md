If you'd like to explore some existing code, there are a variety of samples and existing applications available.

The Communications Workgroup has [a list of **Open Source OSLC projects**](http://open-services.net/wiki/communications/Open-source-software-and-tools/) (along with their licenses).

If you'd like to explore a basic application that provides OSLC Service Provider resources and UI previews, Vijay Kalangumvathakkal of developerWorks [has some simple applications available to download and try out](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/mydeveloperworks/blogs/69ec672c-dd6b-443d-add8-bb9a9a490eba/entry/build_your_own_serviceprovider_that_provides_resource_preview_based_on_oslc_specifications_in_no_time4?lang=en).

Our [tutorial](http://open-services.net/resources/tutorials/integrating-products-with-oslc/) walks you through a [a working adapter that adds OSLC Change Management support to Bugzilla and a simple consumer application](http://open-services.net/resources/tutorials/integrating-products-with-oslc/running-the-examples/).

Finally, many of the software development kits include sample applications. The [OSLC4J component of Eclipse Lyo](http://wiki.eclipse.org/Lyo/BuildingOSLC4J) has a variety of applications: 

- a stock quote sample applications
- a Change Management provider
- a Quality Management provider
- an Automation provider
- the aforementioned Bugzilla Change Management adapter

The [Lyo Client component](http://wiki.eclipse.org/Lyo/BuildClient) in Eclipse Lyo includes additional APIs and sample code that addresses a variety of common OSLC use cases including login, OAuth, service discovery, and queries.

The [OSLC4Net](http://oslc4net.codeplex.com/) project includes sample applications if you favor .NET/C#.
