# Exploring the generated code

This section explores the iotp-adaptor code generated by Lyo Designer, and provides details on completing the implementation. 

## Overall architecture and packaging

The Lyo Designer code generator generates code into a given folder, it does not generate a complete JEE project. So before using Lyo Designer to generate the code, you need to create the folder and overall structure of a JEE dynamic web application. See [eclipse project](https://github.com/eclipse/lyo.designer/wiki/User-Manual-for-Domain-Specification-Modelling#create-a-modelling-project) for details on how to setup a suitable eclipse project.

## Implement IoTPOSLCAdaptorManager.getServiceProviderInfos

get a list of the organization IDs from the IoT Platform
Create a array of ServiceProviderInfos sized by the number of organizations returned
for each orgId by index do:
construct a ServiceProviderInfo and store it at the index position
serviceProviderInfo.name = orgId
serviceProviderInfo.serviceProviderId = orgId (same as the name in this case)

A ServiceProviderInfo has at least a name and serviceProviderId. There can be other extended attributes and methods if needed.

For IoT Platform, ServiceProviderInfo might include:
name = Organization name
serviceProviderId = Organization name
