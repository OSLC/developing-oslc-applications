Open Services for Lifecycle Collaboration (OSLC) is an initiative to define standards that enable easier and more effective integrations between the many tools that software and product developers use. OSLC is a different approach to tool integration that seeks to integrate the resources managed by those tools into the web of data. OSLC uses variety of web integration patterns, which are all either based on or complementary to what the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) calls [Linked Data](http://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/data).

To learn more about core OSLC concepts and architectural underpinnings, read the [OSLC Primer](https://open-services.net/resources/oslc-primer). We'll be implementing many of these core resources and services in this tutorial.

For more information on the value of integrating with open protocols, read our whitepaper ["The Case for Open Services"](https://archive.open-services.net/resources/whitepapers/the-case-for-open-services/).
