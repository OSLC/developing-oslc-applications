The Modelling environment and code generator is known to work on Eclipse
Neon and Oxygen. But, first make sure your Eclipse environment is setup
as expected for general OSLC4J development, as instructed in [ General
Setup for OSLC4J
development](./general-setup-for-oslc4j-development)

The easiest way to install Lyo Designer is via the update-site
<http://download.eclipse.org/lyo/p2/stable/>. (This URL is intended to
be accessed via the Eclipse update functionality, and not via a web
browser.)

1.  Select ***Help \--\> Install New Software\...***
2.  Set ***Work With:*** to the update site
    <http://download.eclipse.org/lyo/p2/stable/>
3.  Select both features (1) ***Lyo Code Generator*** and (2) ***Lyo
    Toolchain Designer***.
4.  Proceed with the installation steps.

-   **Note**: You will receive a warning that the software contains
    unsigned content. Press *OK* to proceed.
-   **Problems installing?**: If you face problems installing the plugin
    (or when updating to a new version), try one of the following:
    1.  check the \"Contact all update sites during install to find
        required software\" option
    2.  check/uncheck "Group items by category" (particularly the case,
        if you get the message "there are no categorized items")
    3.  uninstall existing version and then re-install the plugin again.
