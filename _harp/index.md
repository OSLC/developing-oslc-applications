For a high-level overview of how to add OSLC support to software, we recommend our video "[Getting started on implementing OSLC](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oXqudLmNMI)":

----------------------------------------------

For a more detailed look at what goes into OSLC support, read through our tutorial "[Integrating Products with OSLC](http://archive.open-services.net/resources/tutorials/integrating-products-with-oslc/)", which walks you through building an adapter that adds OSLC support to the popular Bugzilla defect-tracking software. 

The concepts in the tutorial are broadly applicable to other software.

If you are **building an OSLC provider** (in other words, software that *outputs* OSLC resources), you'll learn how to

- [Provide Service Providers and catalogs](http://archive.open-services.net/resources/tutorials/integrating-products-with-oslc/implementing-an-oslc-provider/providing-service-providers-and-catalogs/)
- [Represent Bugzilla bugs as OSLC Change Management resources](http://archive.open-services.net/resources/tutorials/integrating-products-with-oslc/implementing-an-oslc-provider/providing-oslc-representations/)
- [Provide UI Previews](http://archive.open-services.net/resources/tutorials/integrating-products-with-oslc/implementing-an-oslc-provider/providing-ui-previews/)
- [Provide a delegated UI for finding existing bugs](http://archive.open-services.net/resources/tutorials/integrating-products-with-oslc/implementing-an-oslc-provider/providing-a-delegated-ui-for-selection/)
- [Provide a delegated UI for creating new bugs](http://archive.open-services.net/resources/tutorials/integrating-products-with-oslc/implementing-an-oslc-provider/providing-a-delegated-ui-for-creation/)
- [Allow software to programmatically create new bugs](http://archive.open-services.net/resources/tutorials/integrating-products-with-oslc/implementing-an-oslc-provider/providing-a-creation-factory/)

If you are **building an OSLC consumer application**, you'll learn how to:

- [Link to OSLC resources in another application and display previews](http://archive.open-services.net/resources/tutorials/integrating-products-with-oslc/integrating-with-an-oslc-provider/implementing-links-and-previews/)
- [Find, select, and create bugs without leaving the application with delegated UIs](http://archive.open-services.net/resources/tutorials/integrating-products-with-oslc/integrating-with-an-oslc-provider/making-incident-to-defect-linking-easy/)
- [Parse OSLC resources](http://archive.open-services.net/resources/tutorials/integrating-products-with-oslc/integrating-with-an-oslc-provider/implementing-a-customers-to-notify-page/)
- [Create new bugs automatically](http://archive.open-services.net/resources/tutorials/integrating-products-with-oslc/integrating-with-an-oslc-provider/automated-bug-creation/)

The tutorial has working sample applications and [detailed instructions for running them](http://archive.open-services.net/resources/tutorials/integrating-products-with-oslc/running-the-examples/).
