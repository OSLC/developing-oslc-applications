### Eclipse Lyo

The [Eclipse Lyo](http://www.eclipse.org/lyo/) project has a variety of tools to help you adopt OSLC specifications:

- [**OSLC4J**](http://wiki.eclipse.org/Lyo/LyoOSLC4J): a Java SDK for OSLC providers and consumers that lets you define OSLC resources and convert them to Java objects
- [**Perl libraries and samples**](http://wiki.eclipse.org/Lyo/LyoPerl): modules for Perl for interacting with OSLC providers, including the [Net-OSLC PERL library](http://arroway.github.com/Net-OSLC-CM/)
- [**Test Suites**](http://wiki.eclipse.org/Lyo/LyoTestSuite): test if your OSLC applications complies with the requirements of our specifications
- [**Tracked Resource Set SDK**](http://wiki.eclipse.org/Lyo/TRSSDK): a test suite, toolkit, and sample application for the Tracked Resource Set specification

<div class="callout-box"><strong>You do not have to use the Eclipse application to use Eclipse Lyo</strong>: Although much of the documentation assumes you will be using Eclipse, the source code is available in <a href="http://git.eclipse.org/c/?q=lyo">a Git repository</a> and much of it does not require the Eclipse application to work.</div>
