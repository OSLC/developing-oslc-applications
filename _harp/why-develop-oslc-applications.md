Integrating software is hard; we want it to be easier. And we need your help.

[We define standardized ways](https://open-services.net/specifications/) to represent common resources in software development (for example, a defect or a performance test). We also define standardized methods to allow other applications to access, display, preview, find, create, and update those resources.

With standardized resources and methods, any tool can access and manipulate the data and artifacts from any other compliant tool. So instead of a variety of fragile point-to-point integrations you have **one common way to connect and integrate [many products](https://archive.open-services.net/software/)**. It's not quite plug-and-play, but it's close.

**We want OSLC to succeed because better and easier integrations will save everyone time and money**. And we think that software with OSLC integration has a competitive advantage.

Don't just take our word for it. [Icaro Technologies](https://archive.open-services.net/resources/presentations/reducing-system-integration-costs-with-oslc-and-data-federation/) estimated that they could have saved *two million dollars* over two years if they used OSLC standards for a project with more than 10 integrations. And major industry groups like [SPRINT](http://www.sprint-iot.eu/) and [EADS (Airbus)](https://www.airbus.com/en/what-we-do/protect) have decided that OSLC-compliant software can help them collaborate and verify requirements [on highly complex products like commercial airplanes](https://archive.open-services.net/resources/videos/concurrent-engineering-for-systems-based-on-oslc).

OSLC specifications are *free to adopt*, and we want them to spread. So help us out!
